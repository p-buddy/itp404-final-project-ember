# Itp404-final-project-ember

My final project will be a music discovery application called 'Puddy'. It attends to encourage a different type of discovery behavior that experiments with what other non-musical factors can help people to find new music that connects with them (i.e. artist's hometown, band artwork, etc.). I will build a database of musical artists with certain pieces of information  connected to each, and then will display that information in a dynamic interface â€” each piece of info will be linked to music connected through some api (soundcloud or spotify, or something else). Users will also be able to add artists/information about artists.

Seems like it should be a rewarding challenge!
